			<p>Youth Empowerment is youth focused, youth empowerment support groups aimed at developing leadership skills within all the youth we work with. This will include achieving better grades in school and learning to access mental health resources in their community. </p>
			<p> Our groups cover life and leadership development/skill and curriculum. The topics range from anger management, self-esteem, to communication and relationships. We also include discussions on common mental health issues that are common to youth such as depression, self-mutilation, eating disorders, ADHD, suicide and bipolar disorder. </p>
			<p> Finally we are very aware, that in order to be effective with youth, we must be youth friendly, that is, have youth friendly activities, art projects and of course games with goals. All of these activities help our youth develop cooperation and empathetic social skills all related to our goal of creating leadership and educating youth about how to access mental health resources, should they need them. </p>
